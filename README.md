# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

Welcome to my repository for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program. This repository contains all the projects and assignments I completed as part of the Nanodegree, showcasing skills in data modeling, ETL processes, data warehousing, and data lakes.

## Projects

### 1. Data Modeling with PostgreSQL
- **Objective:** Design and implement a data model for a music streaming app.
- **Description:** This project includes creating a relational database schema and SQL queries to analyze user and song data.
- **Files:**
  - `data_modeling_postgres.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data modeling process and SQL queries.
  - `create_tables.py`: Python script to create tables in PostgreSQL.

### 2. Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift
- **Objective:** Build a data warehouse using Amazon Redshift to support analytical queries.
- **Description:** Includes setting up a Redshift cluster, designing a star schema, and creating ETL pipelines to populate the warehouse.
- **Files:**
  - `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create tables in Redshift.
  - `etl.py`: Python script to perform ETL operations and load data into Redshift.

### 3. ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow
- **Objective:** Develop an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate data workflows.
- **Description:** This project involves creating Airflow DAGs to manage ETL workflows and ensure data consistency.
- **Files:**
  - `dag_etl.py`: Python file containing the Airflow DAG for ETL processes.
  - `airflow_config.yaml`: Configuration file for setting up Airflow.

### 4. Data Lake with Apache Spark and AWS
- **Objective:** Build a scalable data lake architecture using Apache Spark and AWS services.
- **Description:** Focuses on creating a data lake solution for large-scale data storage and processing.
- **Files:**
  - `spark_job.py`: Python script to process data using Apache Spark.
  - `aws_setup.md`: Documentation for setting up AWS services.
